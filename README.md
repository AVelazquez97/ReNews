# 2. Preliminary Considerations

## A. Installation and execution of XAMPP

1. Download the XAMPP installer from the official website: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
  Usually, is installed inside `/opt/` folder. 
  
2. Then, is recommended to add the followings lines to the `~/.bashrc` file, to make it easier to run the server and 
 execute php:

    ```
    export "PATH=$PATH:/opt/lampp/bin:$PATH"
    export "PATH=$PATH:/opt/lampp:$PATH" 
    ```

    Consider to edit the `~/.bashrc` file with the following command:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
3. And, apply the changes with the following command:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
4. Repeat the stepts 2 and 3 but sudo su, to make the changes permanent.

5. After installed, run the server with the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
    ```
## B. Installation of Composer
  On the project's root folder, composer is already installed. But, if you want to install it globally, you must 
  run the following commands:

  - Download the installer:

    ```bash
    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer','composer-setup.php');"
    ```

  - Install Composer and move it to the `/opt/lampp/bin` folder:
    ```bash
    php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/opt/lampp/bin --filename=composer
    ```

  - Delete the installer:
    ```bash
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
    ```

  - Check the installation:
    ```bash
    php composer -V
    ```

## C. Creation of the Database

- You can access to MySQL Server with PHPMyAdmin or any other client. Also, can be accessed from command line, 
  with the following command:

  ```bash
  mysql -h localhost -u root
  ```
  

- DB creation and user assignment:

  Once inside the MySQL server, the database must be created with the following command:

  ```
  CREATE DATABASE reNews;
  ```
  The user to be used for the connection must be created with the following command:

  ```
  CREATE USER admin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "admin";
  ```
  
  And grant all privileges to the user with the following command:
  ```
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON reNews.* TO admin@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
  ```

- Creation of the tables:

  - Users table:
  ```
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    nickname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  );
  ```

## D. Downloading the project from GitHub

- To download the project it is necessary to have Git installed. Then, it is enough to enter the terminal and 
  enter the followings commands:

  ```bash
  cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
  git clone https://github.com/ignfer/ReNews.git
  ```
