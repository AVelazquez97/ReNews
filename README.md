# 2. Preliminary Considerations

## A. Installation and execution of XAMPP

- Download the XAMPP installer from the official website: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
 
  Usually, is installed inside `/opt/` folder. 


- After installed, run the server with the following command:
    
  ```bash
  sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
  ```
## B. Installation of Composer

  On backend folder, composer is already installed. But, if you want to install it globally, you must run the 
   following commands:

  - Download the installer:

    ```bash
    /opt/lampp/bin/php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer','composer-setup.php');"
    ```

  - Install Composer and move it to the `/usr/local/bin` folder:
    ```bash
    /opt/lampp/bin/php  composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
    ```

  - Delete the installer:
    ```bash
    /opt/lampp/bin/php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
    ```

  - Check the installation:
    ```bash
    /opt/lampp/bin/php /usr/local/bin/composer --V
    ```

## C. Creation of the Database

- You can access to MySQL Server with PHPMyAdmin or any other client. Also, can be accessed from command line, 
  with the following command:

   ```bash
   /opt/lampp/bin/mysql -h localhost -u root
   ```
   But first, you must access to the MySQL/MariaDB conf file (`/opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf`) and edit the password field, in the `[client]` section.
   
   You can do that with this command:
   ```bash
   nano /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
   ```


- DB creation and user assignment:

  Once inside the MySQL server, the database must be created with the following command:

  ```
  CREATE DATABASE reNews;
  ```
  The user to be used for the connection must be created with the following command:

  ```
  CREATE USER reNewsAdmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "renews";
  ```
  
  And grant all privileges to the user with the following command:
  ```
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON reNews.* TO reNewsAdmin@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
  ```

- Creation of the tables:

## D. Downloading the project from GitHub

- To download the project it is necessary to have Git installed. Then, it is enough to enter the terminal and 
  enter the following command:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ignfer/ReNews.git
  ```
