# 2. Preliminary Considerations

## A. Installation and execution of XAMPP

  1. Download the XAMPP installer from the official website: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
     Usually, is installed on `/opt/` folder. 
    
  2. After installed, run the server with the following command: 

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
    ```
  
## B. Creation of the Database

- Access to MySQL Server with PHPMyAdmin or any other client. Also can be accessed from command line, with the following command:

   ```bash
   /opt/lampp/bin/mysql -h localhost -u root
   ```
   But first, you must access to the MySQL/MariaDB conf file (`/opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf`) and edit the password field, in the `[client]` section.
   ```
   You can do it that, with this command:
   ```bash
   nano /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
   ```


- DB creation and user assignment:

  Once inside the MySQL server, the database must be created with the following command:

  ```
  `CREATE DATABASE reNews;`
  ```
  The user to be used for the connection must be created with the following command:

  ```
    CREATE USER reNewsAdmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "reNews";
  ```

  ```
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON reNews.* TO reNewsAdmin@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
  ```

- Creation of the tables:

## C. Downloading the project from GitHub

- To download the project it is necessary to have Git installed. Then, it is enough to enter the terminal and 
  enter the following command:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ignfer/ReNews.git
  ```
